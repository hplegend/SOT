Self-organizing tree (SOT) model example from Palubicki et al, Self-organizing
tree models for image synthesis, *ACM Transactions on Graphics* **28**(3), 58:1-10, 2009.

This folder contains the actual LPFG-SOT code (C++ and L+C) to run directly in the LPFG simulator.
The LPFG simulator is available under L-studio (Win) or VLab (Mac/Unix) simulation environment.
See <http://algorithmicbotany.org/virtual_laboratory/> for the software documentation, download, and updates.
